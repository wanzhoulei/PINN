## 1D Poisson PINN Solver
All tools and methods are defined in the file PINN_tools.py
The other two files run two experiments of std GD and Gauss Newton with:
std GD: 80000 iterations, random seed 20
Gauss Newton: 7000 iterations, random seed 20, dampping factor 0

They save the outputs in the results folder.
